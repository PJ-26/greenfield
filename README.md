## Summary
There are many benefits out there for keeping a journal and logging your mood each day. It helps you become more conscious of your feelings, allows you to more clearly see the factors that may cause certains moods, and gives you a general overview of what kind of person you are and how you change over time.

We can also use this overall data on our emotions to find ways to increase our productivity. By tracking your habits alongside your moods, you are not only able to see your progress on how well you mantain your habits, but also how your productivity level relates to your mood.

This app is a fun and easy way to keep track of your mood and productivity by keeping diary entries and habit logs that generate beautiful and informative visuals to show you patterns in your emotions and behavior.

## How it Works

### Diary Entries
The best way to build up your mood data is using the app to write a diary entry every day. Watson analyzes each diary entry to determine your mood for the day based on what you write. 

### Personality Profile
In addition to determining your mood each day, your diary entries are also cumulatively analyzed to create your own personality profile. The more entries you write, the more accurate your profile will be. The database will also keep track of any changes in your personality over time. 

### Habit Tracker
Trying to pick up a new healthy habit or drop an unhealthy one? The habit tracking feature not only holds you accountable, but also helps you find patterns to detetmine what factors make you more or less productive.

### Data Visualization
As you add more information about your daily life over time, you build upon several different visual representations that show how your mood changes over time and how it relates to your productivity level.
